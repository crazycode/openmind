                    <h3>Do you know your customer?</h3>
                    <p>Many product companies make product decisions with a flawed understanding of what’s
                        important to their customers. Focus groups, customer advisory boards, and one-on-one
                        conversations all provide data points to determine customer wants and needs. But
                        these approaches make broad assumptions about your users based upon a limited set
                        of anecdotal evidence.</p>
                    <p><strong>OpenMind</strong> enables you to build an online community with your customers
                        and partners, allowing you to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find out what features and improvements your customers as a whole would value most</li>
                        <li>Engage in an online discussion with your users to gain deeper insights into their needs </li>
                        <li>Communicate upcoming releases, closing the loop on customer feedback – your customers can see exactly which features became committed features of a future release based upon community feedback </li>
                        <li>Gain deeper insights into specific targeted topic areas through user surveys </li>
                        <li>Allow customers to engage in online discussion with each other and with you via online forums </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>OpenMind</strong> uses a unique allocation-based point voting system that
                        creates an environment in which customers will make the same type of trade-off decisions
                        that you do. It’s not enough to know whether a feature request is a good idea or
                        not – you need to know which ideas your customers value most.</p>
                    <p>Product managers make difficult decisions every day – part of their job is to measure
                        the trade-offs in order to determine what subset of possible features and improvements
                        to address in a release based upon a limited number of resources. For example, the
                        product manager must himself or herself that question: “If I have 10 items on a
                        list of possible features for a release and I can only do 6 of them, which 4 would
                        provide the most value to my customers?”</p>
                    <p><strong>OpenMind</strong>’s allocations create an environment in which your customers
                        make the same tradeoffs that you do. If I can only vote a limited number of times,
                        I will choose wisely where to spend my votes rather than indicating every possible
                        idea that sounds interesting to me.</p>
