== Description

When writing many complex fixtures for testing within your applications or
plugins, it can become cumbersome to keep track of which fixtures reference
which other fixtures and going back and forther between files to track ids.
This plugin takes the route offered by unit tests by allowing you to reference
those fixtures by name rathern than by id.

== Usage

See the PluginAWeek::FixtureReferences API for usage information.

=== Example

employees.yml:
  <% id = 0 %>
  bob:
    id: <%= id += 1 %>
    name: Bob
    
  joe:
    id: <%= id += 1 %>
    name: Joe

departments.yml:
  <%
  fixtures :employees
  id = 0
  %>
  
  packaging:
    id: <%= id += 1 %>
    name: Packaging
    manager_id: <%= employees(:bob) %>

== Testing

Before you can run any tests, the following gems must be installed:
* plugin_test_helper[http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Plugin_test_helper]
